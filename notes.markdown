# Random Notes

## High Level Workflow/UI
* Don't start on a dashboard. Want users to get right into the app seeing featured content.
* Have a custom tab bar the disappears when you drill in.
* 5 tabs: Featured, Events, Businesses, Search, Profile
** Alternative: Featured, Loyalty, Explore, Search, Profile
* Search should be a top-level concept, not tucked into each category

### Event Details View
* Do we need a way to follow companies from the event details view (currently only available when viewing a company's details).
* Maybe slide left and right between the event details and the company details?

## Events
* What are the ramifications of a user saying he's going to attend something? The business can be given that data. Are there any benefits to the user?

## Businesses
* Where does the information from the businesses you're following show up?


## Lists of data (lists of events, businesses, notifications, etc.)
* Have the table view load more automatically when you scroll to the bottom of the list

## Sharing information
* Do you have your own link shortener?
